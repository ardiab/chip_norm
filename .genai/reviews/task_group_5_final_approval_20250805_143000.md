# Code Review: Task Group 5

**Decision:** Approve

**Summary:**
The implementation correctly and robustly fulfills all requirements of the task group. The code is clean, maintainable, and architecturally consistent. The data loading pipeline is now fully driven by the Hydra configuration, from the input file paths to the training hyperparameters. The refactored code is a significant improvement over the previous state.
