# Code Review: Task Group 6: Decompose Data Loading and Implement Memory-Efficient Pre-processing (Follow-up)

**Decision:** Approve

**Summary:**
The implementation now correctly and robustly fulfills all requirements of the task group. The requested changes from the previous review have been addressed effectively. The code is now cleaner, more maintainable, and architecturally consistent.

*   **Data Aggregation:** The `_aggregate_dataframe_bins` function now uses a more efficient `groupby` operation.
*   **Non-Zero Filtering:** The non-zero mask is now applied independently for each replicate, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Replicate Handling:** The `replicate_mode` flag has been removed, and the logic now handles single and multiple replicates generically.
*   **Memory Usage:** The code now pre-allocates numpy arrays, which is a significant memory optimization.
