# Review 1: create_legacy_experiment_config

**Decision:** Request Changes

**Summary:**
The implementation provides a well-structured legacy experiment configuration and comprehensive tests. However, the configuration cannot load successfully because it references two non-existent base configuration files: `data/legacy_multi_replicate` and `model/legacy_nb_mu_r`. This is a critical issue that prevents the configuration from being usable at all, causing all tests to fail immediately during Hydra composition.

---

**Detailed Feedback:**
* **Finding:** Missing Required Base Configuration Files
  * **File:** `configs/experiment/legacy_reproduction.yaml`
  * **Issue:** The configuration references `- /model: legacy_nb_mu_r` and `- /data: legacy_multi_replicate` but these base configuration files do not exist. Available configs are `model/nb_mu_r_small` and `data/h3k27me3_200bp`, `data/h3k27me3_preprocess`.
  * **Suggestion:** Create the missing base configuration files `configs/model/legacy_nb_mu_r.yaml` and `configs/data/legacy_multi_replicate.yaml` to support the experiment configuration.
  * **Reasoning:** Without these base configs, the Hydra configuration system cannot compose the experiment configuration, making it completely unusable. This is a blocking issue that prevents any functionality from working.

* **Finding:** Configuration Structure Duplication
  * **File:** `configs/experiment/legacy_reproduction.yaml`
  * **Issue:** Configuration parameters are duplicated between top-level keys (scheduler, wandb, checkpointing) and the trainer_config section, creating potential inconsistency.
  * **Suggestion:** Consolidate configuration by either removing the top-level duplicates and keeping only trainer_config, or restructuring to eliminate the duplication.
  * **Reasoning:** Duplication can lead to configuration drift and makes the config harder to maintain. A single source of truth for each parameter improves maintainability.

# Review 2: create_legacy_experiment_config

**Decision:** Approve

**Summary:**
The implementation correctly and robustly fulfills all requirements of the task with no issues found. All critical issues from the previous review have been resolved - the missing base configuration files have been created and the configuration now loads successfully. All 9 tests pass, confirming that the legacy experiment configuration reproduces the exact training setup from the legacy script including composite loss functions, sequential learning rate scheduling, dual checkpointing strategies, and Weights & Biases integration. The code is clean, maintainable, and architecturally consistent.
