# Review 1: implement_advanced_losses

**Decision:** Request Changes

**Summary:**
The implementation correctly fulfills the algorithmic requirements and passes all tests. However, a critical architectural inconsistency prevents integration with the existing training system. The individual loss functions use different signatures than expected by the loss registry interface.

---

**Detailed Feedback:**
* **Finding:** Individual Loss Functions Have Incompatible Signatures for Direct Registry Use
    * **File:** `scripts/run.py` and `chipvi/training/losses.py`
    * **Issue:** The new loss functions (`concordance_loss_nce`, `negative_pearson_loss`, `quantile_absolute_loss`) are registered in `LOSS_REGISTRY` but have signatures incompatible with the expected `loss_fn(model_outputs: dict, batch: dict)` interface used by existing loss functions like `replicate_concordance_mse_loss`.
    * **Suggestion:** Create wrapper functions for each loss that extract the required data from `model_outputs` and `batch` dictionaries and call the core algorithmic functions, or modify the signatures to match the expected interface.
    * **Reasoning:** Without proper interface compatibility, these loss functions cannot be used in the actual training pipeline, making the implementation non-functional despite correct algorithms and passing tests.

# Review 2: implement_advanced_losses

**Decision:** Approve

**Summary:**
The implementation correctly and robustly fulfills all requirements of the task group with no issues found. The code is clean, maintainable, and architecturally consistent. All previous review concerns have been properly addressed with wrapper functions that enable seamless integration with the training pipeline.
