# Review 1: create_wandb_mock

**Decision:** Approve

**Summary:**
The implementation correctly and robustly fulfills all requirements of the task with no issues found. The MockWandB class successfully intercepts wandb.init(), wandb.log(), and wandb.finish() calls, prevents network calls, and provides comprehensive utilities for test assertions. All 9 test cases pass, confirming the mock works as specified. The code is clean, maintainable, and architecturally consistent with the project structure.
