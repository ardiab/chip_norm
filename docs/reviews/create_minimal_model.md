# Review 1: create_minimal_model

**Decision:** Request Changes

**Summary:**
The implementation correctly fulfills most requirements of the task group and all tests pass. However, a critical interface mismatch exists where the MinimalTestModel returns a dictionary instead of a tuple like the original TechNB_mu_r model. This violates the requirement to "implement the same interface as TechNB_mu_r" and could break compatibility with existing code expecting tuple outputs.

---

**Detailed Feedback:**
*   **Finding:** Interface Mismatch with TechNB_mu_r
    *   **File:** `tests/models/minimal_model.py`
    *   **Issue:** The forward method returns a dictionary `{"mu": ..., "r": ...}` while TechNB_mu_r returns a tuple `(mu, r)`. This violates the acceptance criteria stating the model must implement the same interface.
    *   **Suggestion:** Modify the forward method to return `(torch.exp(log_mu), torch.exp(log_r))` instead of a dictionary.
    *   **Reasoning:** Maintaining interface compatibility ensures the minimal model can be used as a drop-in replacement for TechNB_mu_r in testing scenarios without modifying calling code.

*   **Finding:** Test Incorrectly Validates Interface Difference
    *   **File:** `tests/test_minimal_model.py`
    *   **Issue:** The test `test_same_interface_as_technb_mu_r` acknowledges the interface difference but treats both tuple and dict returns as valid, contradicting the requirement.
    *   **Suggestion:** Update the test to verify that both models return the same data structure type (tuple) and remove assertions about dict keys.
    *   **Reasoning:** Tests should enforce the specified requirements strictly to catch interface violations.

# Review 2: create_minimal_model

**Decision:** Approve

**Summary:**
The implementation correctly and robustly fulfills all requirements of the task group with no issues found. All review items from the previous review have been successfully addressed - the model now returns a tuple matching the TechNB_mu_r interface, and all tests have been updated accordingly. The code is clean, maintainable, and architecturally consistent.
