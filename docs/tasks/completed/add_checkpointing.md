# Task Document: Add Flexible Checkpointing System

**Task ID:** add_checkpointing

**Description:**
Implement a configurable multi-strategy checkpointing system that can save models based on various metrics and loss components. This system will support monitoring multiple metrics simultaneously, saving different checkpoints for different optimization objectives, and provide flexible configuration for checkpoint management.

**Blocked By:**
- `enhance_trainer`
- `implement_validation_metrics`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple metrics can be monitored simultaneously for checkpointing
- Separate checkpoint files saved for different metrics (e.g., best_loss.pt, best_corr.pt)
- Individual loss components can trigger checkpoints independently
- Saved checkpoints are complete and loadable for inference or training resumption
- Old checkpoints can be optionally overwritten based on configuration

**Test Scenarios (for the agent to implement):**
1. **Multi-Metric Checkpointing:** Test that different metrics trigger saves to different files at appropriate times.
2. **Loss Component Tracking:** Verify individual loss components (e.g., concordance loss) can trigger checkpoints independently of total loss.
3. **Checkpoint File Integrity:** Ensure saved model files contain complete state_dict and metadata, and can be successfully loaded.
4. **Configuration Flexibility:** Test various checkpointing configurations work correctly (single metric, multiple metrics, disabled).
5. **Improvement Detection:** Verify the system correctly identifies when a metric has improved based on mode (min/max).
6. **Concurrent Strategy Execution:** Test multiple checkpointing strategies can run simultaneously without interfering.
7. **Checkpoint Overwrite Control:** Verify old checkpoints are overwritten when configured, or timestamped versions saved when not.

**Implementation Todos:**
1. **Implement tests for checkpointing system:**
   a. Create `tests/test_checkpointing.py`
   b. Test multi-metric monitoring with mock metrics
   c. Test checkpoint saving creates correct files
   d. Test checkpoint loading restores model state
   e. Test overwrite behavior with existing files
   f. Test improvement detection logic

2. **Ensure tests fail:** Run tests before implementation

3. **Create CheckpointManager class in `chipvi/training/checkpoint_manager.py`:**
   a. Initialize with output_dir and checkpoint_configs list
   b. Each config contains:
      - metric_name: what to monitor (e.g., 'val_loss', 'val_residual_spearman')
      - mode: 'min' or 'max' for improvement direction
      - filename: checkpoint filename (e.g., 'best_loss.pt')
      - overwrite: boolean for overwrite behavior
   c. Track best values for each metric in dictionary
   d. Track filenames for each strategy

4. **Implement checkpoint monitoring logic:**
   a. Create `update(metrics_dict, model_state_dict, epoch)` method
   b. For each checkpoint strategy:
      - Extract metric value from metrics_dict
      - Compare with best value based on mode (min/max)
      - If improved, save checkpoint and update best value
   c. Support nested metric names (e.g., 'loss_components.concordance')
   d. Handle missing metrics gracefully with warnings

5. **Implement checkpoint saving:**
   a. Create `save_checkpoint(state_dict, filepath, overwrite, metadata)` method
   b. If overwrite=False and file exists, append timestamp
   c. Save using torch.save() with additional metadata:
      - epoch number
      - metric value that triggered save
      - timestamp
      - configuration used
   d. Log checkpoint saves to console/W&B

6. **Implement checkpoint loading:**
   a. Create static method `load_checkpoint(filepath)`
   b. Load state_dict and metadata using torch.load()
   c. Return state_dict and metadata separately
   d. Handle missing files with informative errors

7. **Integrate with Trainer class:**
   a. Initialize CheckpointManager in Trainer.__init__ if config provided
   b. After each validation epoch, call manager.update(metrics, model.state_dict(), epoch)
   c. Pass all relevant metrics including loss components
   d. At training end, log which checkpoints were saved

8. **Add configuration support:**
   a. Parse checkpoint config from Hydra config
   b. Support both single and multiple checkpoint strategies
   c. Validate configuration (valid modes, unique filenames)
   d. Set sensible defaults if not specified

9. **Ensure all tests pass:** Verify checkpointing system works correctly

## Completion Note

Successfully implemented a flexible checkpointing system with the following key features:
- **CheckpointManager class** that supports multiple concurrent checkpointing strategies based on different metrics
- **Multi-metric monitoring** with configurable improvement detection (min/max modes) 
- **Loss component tracking** that can independently trigger checkpoints for nested metrics using dot notation
- **Flexible overwrite control** with optional timestamping for checkpoint preservation
- **Full integration with Trainer class** including configuration parsing, validation, and automatic checkpoint summary logging
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with 11 test cases covering all acceptance criteria including file integrity, concurrent strategies, and edge cases

All 62 tests pass, demonstrating that the checkpointing system works correctly and integrates seamlessly with existing training functionality.
