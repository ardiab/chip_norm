# Task Document: Create mock infrastructure for wandb

**Task ID:** create_wandb_mock

**Description:**
Set up a reusable mocking mechanism for Weights & Biases (wandb) that intercepts all wandb API calls during testing. This mock will prevent actual network calls to wandb servers while capturing all logged metrics and configurations for verification in tests.

**Blocked By:**
- (None)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mock module successfully intercepts wandb.init(), wandb.log(), and wandb.finish() calls
- All logged metrics are captured and accessible for test assertions
- Mock is reusable across different test files
- No actual network calls are made to wandb servers

**Test Scenarios (for the agent to implement):**
1. **Mock initialization:** Test that wandb.init() can be called with various configurations without actually connecting to wandb servers
2. **Log capture:** Test that wandb.log() calls are intercepted and metrics are stored for later assertion
3. **Finish handling:** Test that wandb.finish() is handled gracefully without errors
4. **Configuration pass-through:** Test that wandb configuration parameters (project, entity, tags) are captured correctly
5. **Multiple log calls:** Test that multiple wandb.log() calls accumulate metrics properly

**Implementation Todos:**
1. **Implement tests:**
   a. Create test file `tests/test_wandb_mock.py`
   b. Write test for mock initialization with different configurations
   c. Write test for log capture functionality
   d. Write test for finish handling
   e. Write test for configuration parameter capture
   f. Write test for multiple log calls accumulation
2. **Ensure tests fail:** Run the tests implemented in step (1) and ensure that they fail (feature not yet implemented)
3. **Implement code:**
   a. Create mock module in `tests/mocks/wandb_mock.py`
   b. Implement MockWandB class with init, log, and finish methods
   c. Create context manager or fixture for easy use in tests
   d. Implement metric storage and retrieval mechanisms
   e. Add utilities for asserting on logged values
4. **Ensure all tests are passing:** Run all tests to ensure that code is functioning correctly

**Completion Note:**
Successfully implemented a comprehensive wandb mock infrastructure with full test coverage. The MockWandB class intercepts all wandb API calls (init, log, finish) and provides utilities for test assertions. All 9 test cases pass, confirming the mock prevents network calls while capturing metrics and configurations for verification.
